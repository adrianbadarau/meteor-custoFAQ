# meteor-custoFAQ
A simple single page app using meteor to manage the faq part of a bigger application

This app uses the meteor [huston-admin](https://github.com/gterrono/houston) to power the back end accesible at /admin.    
From that link you can do all the CRUD functions regarding the question data.   
It utilises the Zurb Foundation CSS framework to display the data in a clean and simple accordeon design.
